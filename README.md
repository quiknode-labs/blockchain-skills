# Blockchain Skills

> A collection of AI agent skills for blockchain development, powered by [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/)

## Introduction

This repository contains a curated set of skills that enable AI agents to interact with blockchain networks, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. Each skill provides specialized knowledge and capabilities for specific blockchain ecosystems and protocols.

## What are Skills?

Skills are structured instruction sets that AI agents can use to perform blockchain-related tasks. They provide:

- **Context** - Domain-specific knowledge about protocols, APIs, and best practices
- **Capabilities** - Step-by-step guidance for common operations
- **Integration** - Direct access to Quicknode's RPC endpoints and APIs

When an AI agent loads a skill, it gains the ability to help you build, deploy, and interact with blockchain applications.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `quicknode-skill` | Quicknode infrastructure - RPC endpoints (80+ chains), Streams, Webhooks, IPFS, Add-ons, Yellowstone gRPC, Hypercore, SQL Explorer, x402, Key-Value Store, SDK, Admin API |

## Installation

### Using [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/)

```bash
npx skills add quiknode-labs/blockchain-skills
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use natural language prompts to interact with Quicknode's infrastructure:

- "Set up a stream to monitor new blocks on Ethereum"
- "Create a filter for large USDC transfers"
- "Get the SOL balance for this wallet address"
- "Check the ETH balance across multiple wallets"
- "Query recent trades on Hyperliquid for BTC"
- "Show me whale trades above $500k notional"
- "Get liquidation data for the last 24 hours"

## Quicknode Integration

This repository leverages Quicknode's infrastructure for reliable blockchain access:

### RPC Endpoints

Connect to 80+ blockchain networks with low-latency RPC endpoints:
- Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base
- Solana, Bitcoin, TON, TRON, StarkNet
- And many more...

### Streams

Real-time blockchain data delivery:
- Block and transaction streaming
- Custom filters and transformations
- Webhook destinations

### SQL Explorer

Direct SQL access to indexed blockchain data:
- Query 371.9B+ rows of Hyperliquid (HyperCore) data
- Standard SQL syntax with 26 pre-built queries
- Trading, orders, fills, funding, liquidations, market data
- REST API for programmatic access

### Add-ons

Extend functionality with marketplace add-ons:
- Token and NFT APIs
- DeFi data feeds
- Historical data access
- Enhanced RPC methods
